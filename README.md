# EXCEL FUNCTIONS

# Text Function


The TEXT function in Excel helps you change how information looks on the screen without changing the real data. People often use it to make reports and show data in a way that's easy for others to read.

LENGTH


In Excel, the LEN function helps you figure out how long a piece of text is by counting all the letters, numbers, spaces, and special characters in it. People use it to see how big or small the text is, which can be useful for different types of work like analyzing data and working with text.
